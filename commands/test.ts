In order to create a command, you essentially replicate what is below.
export const <some name>: Machi = {
    data: new SlashCommandBuilder() and with your added options.
        - Note: if you don't add a name, the name will end up being the variable name
    execture: async (interaction: CommandInteraction) => {
        this is where you put all the command stuff
    }
    upload: -1 or 0 or 1
        - -1: This is so you can manually test your command without it being included the discord command list
        - 0: This command is added to the guilds given if it hasnt been added before
        - 1: This command is forcefully updated, useful if you need to update the commnad information of a command
            - Make sure to change it back to 0 once you have updated it however
